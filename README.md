# noughts-and-crosses

This is a toy project to practice my skills in regards to IIFE's and 
distinguishing between private and public variables, which I denote 
with an underscore for privacy. The aesthetics are minimal and are not 
intended to be responsive, as this was not the focus of the project. 
It also makes extensive use of the module pattern of functions to keep 
everything organised and sectioned off, only returning to global scope 
what will need to be used elsewhere, and even then packaged in an object.
